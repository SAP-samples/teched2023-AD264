# Prerequisites


## SAP Business Application Studio

This tutorial assumes you have access to _SAP Business Application Studio_ to develop the application.

If you are attending a guided hands-on session by SAP with a preconfigured (shared) account, [see these instructions](./guided.md).

Otherwise, to go through this tutorial on you own, follow these links to

- [Get a trial or free tier account on SAP BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-cockpit-setup.html)
- [Set up SAP Business Application Studio](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html)

## Browser

Make sure you have access to a browser, preferably Google Chrome.

Also, a **JSON viewer** is helpful to be installed as a browser extension.  See some [examples from the Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/json%20viewer).


## Let's Start

Continue to the [first exercise](../ex1/README.md) in which you will create an initial version of an _Incidents Management_ application.
